# Relational Databases

# Data is stored in tables (also called relations)
# Tables consist of rows and columns

# In general, each table represents 1 entity type (e.g. student)
# Columns represent attributes of that entity
# Rows are instances of that entity

# In such database, we can:
# Create data
# Read data
# Update data
# Delete data
# Or usually refered to as CRUD

# RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
# We will PostgeSQL (also known as Postgres) as our RDBMS 

# SQL - Structured Query Language
# It is the language used to work with RDBMS

# To start, we need:
# - Download and install PostreSQL
#   - During installation you can leave everything on default
#   - Remember/Write down the password that you set during the installation
