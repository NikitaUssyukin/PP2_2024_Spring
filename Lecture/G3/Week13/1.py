# Databases

# Lets imagine a database with students
# Such a database will contain:
# - name
# - ID
# - study year
# - phone number

# Lets take a spreadsheet as an example of a database
# Table represents one class of entities (e.g. students)
# Rows in the table represent instances of this class, i.e.
# individual entities (students). Rows are also called records or tuples
# Columns represent attributes related to these entities

# RDB - Relational Database
# Relational databases store data also in tables. 

# RDBMS - Relational Database Management System

# CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
# CRUD describes 4 main operations with the database

# PostgreSQL (also known as Postgres) will be used as our RDBMS
